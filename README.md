Project Title: Predicting Data Scientist Salaries with Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

In this project, we aim to analyze and predict data scientist salaries based on various features that may influence compensation. Data scientists are in high demand, and understanding the factors affecting their salaries can provide valuable insights for both job seekers and employers. We'll use linear regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor to build predictive models for data scientist salaries.
